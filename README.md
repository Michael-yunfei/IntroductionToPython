# Introduction To Python

This is my repository for people who want to learn Python. The main textbook I used in this course is:

* Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, by *John V. Guttag*

The outline of this course is based on the module from Duke Univeristy:

* [Data Science Tools](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/bios-821-2017/index.html)

I also found the following book is very uself:

* Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python, by *Brett Slatkin*

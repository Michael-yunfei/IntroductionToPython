# Introduction To Python

This is my repository for people who want to learn Python. The main textbook I used in this course is:

* Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, by *John V. Guttag*
* Learning Python, by *Mark Lutz*
* mastering object-oriented python, by *steven F.Lott*


The outline of this course is based on the module from Duke Univeristy:

* [Data Science Tools](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/bios-821-2017/index.html)

I also found the following books very uself:

* Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python, by *Brett Slatkin*
* Fluent Python, by *Luciano Ramalho*

Of course, there are many fantastic online resources right now. Personally, I visit the following websites very often:

* [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
* [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)
* [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/)
